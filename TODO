1. Make some statistics about the data, e.g. :
    1.1. Commits amount by continents;
    1.2. Commits by projects;
    1.3. Commit frequencies by file;
    1.4. Commits per author;
    # Commit frequencies by file path parts;
    1.5. Bug status frequencies;
    1.6. Bug fix time;
    1.7. Bug frequencies by type;


==============

1. Make some statistics about the data, e.g. :
    1.1. comment frequencies in a commit
    1.2. commit frequencies for a commit-owner
    1.3.


2. Cluster the bugs
fast resolves vs. long not resolved

3. Cluster the commits
commit that result in more bugs vs. clean commit with not many bugs following them

4. Prediction
predict the commits that might result in more bugs
