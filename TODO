1. Make some statistics about the data, e.g. :
    1.1. comment frequencies in a commit
    1.2. commit frequencies for a commit-owner
    1.3. 


2. Cluster the bugs
fast resolves vs. long not resolved

3. Cluster the commits 
commit that result in more bugs vs. clean commit with not many bugs following them

4. Prediction
predict the commits that might result in more bugs

5.
